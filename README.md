# Dart bindings to [GLFW](http://glfw.org/) 3.1.1.

It is unlikely that programs written with these bindings will work on OSX due to
requirements that the main thread be the one handling events.

# Steps to generate the bindings
```shell
mkdir lib/src/generated/
dart tools/glfw_generator.dart --glfw3_path=<path to glfw3.h>
cp generated/* ../lib/src/generated/
```

# Steps to compile the bindings

Set environment variables DART_SDK, GLFW_INCLUDE, and GLFW_LIB.

```shell
cd lib/
dart ../tools/glfw_compile.dart
```

Note that if you set the `GLFW_LIB` variable when compiling, you must also set
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the same directory when running your program or
the Dart VM will not be able to find `libglfw.so`.

# Notes about the auto-generated bindings

- `glfwWindowShouldClose` returns an `int`, rather than a `bool`, but unlike
  in C, the expression `!(1)` returns true so you must explicitly test
    `glfwWindowShouldClose(window) != 1`
  - There is also a convenience function\
      `bool glfwWindowShouldCloseAsBool(GLFWwindow window)`

# The following functions have changed from the C GLFW API
These changes are due to the C library's use of pointer arguments to return
values. See also lib/src/manual\_bindings.dart.

- glfwGetVersion
  - Returns a `GLFWVersion` instance which has `major`, `minor`, `rev` fields.
- glfwGetMonitors
  - Returns a `List<GLFWmonitor>` instance.
- glfwGetMonitorPos
  - Returns a `Point` instance.
- glfwGetMonitorPhysicalSize
  - Returns a `Rectangle` instance with `xpos` and `ypos` set to 0.
- glfwGetVideoModes
  - Returns a `List<GLFWvidmode>` instance.
- glfwGetWindowPos
  - Returns a `Point` instance.
- glfwGetWindowSize
  - Returns a `Rectangle` instance with `xpos` and `ypos` set to 0.
- glfwGetFramebufferSize
  - Returns a `Rectangle` instance with `xpos` and `ypos` set to 0.
- glfwGetWindowFrameSize
  - Returns a `Rectangle` instance.
- glfwSetWindowUserPointer
  - `pointer` parameter is a Dart `Object`.
- glfwGetWindowUserPointer
  - Returns an `Object` instance.
- glfwGetCursorPos
  - Returns a `Point` instance.
- glfwGetJoystickAxes
  - Returns a `List<double>` instance.
- glfwGetJoystickButtons
  - Returns a `List<int>` instance.

# The following functions are additions to the C GLFW API
- glfwSwapBuffersAsync
  - An async version of glfwSwapBuffers that can be `await`-ed. This avoids
  blocking the current isolate while the glfwSwapBuffers call is waiting to
  finish.
